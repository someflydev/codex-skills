# Skill Pack Generator Prompt Template

Use this template to generate a new skill pack for a repeated project pattern.

## Fill In These Inputs

- `pack_name`: `<kebab-pack-name>`
- `category_root`: `skills/<category>/`
- `project_pattern`: `<what repeats, e.g. API client scaffolding>`
- `target_skill_count`: `<5-12>`
- `pack_goal`: `<what operator outcome this pack enables>`
- `repo_constraints`: `<language/tooling/safety constraints>`
- `fit_plan`: `<where this pack fits in the broader category layout>`
- `alt_strategy_a`: `<meaningful divergence #1>`
- `alt_strategy_b`: `<meaningful divergence #2>`

## Prompt (Reusable)

Generate the `{{pack_name}}` skill pack for the repeated project pattern: `{{project_pattern}}`.

Create **{{target_skill_count}} base skills** in `{{category_root}}` and **an `_ALT` variant for each skill**.

Outputs must be repo-root-relative by default and should fit this pack into the category layout:
- Category fit plan: `{{fit_plan}}`

Each generated skill must include:
- `SKILL.md`
- `EXAMPLES.md`
- `CHECKLIST.md`

The pack should enable this operator outcome:
- `{{pack_goal}}`

Repository / implementation constraints:
- `{{repo_constraints}}`

## Required Behavior (Do Not Skip)

1. Force narrow scope per skill.
   - Each skill has one clear job and explicit inputs/outputs.
   - Avoid giant orchestrator skills that mix planning, execution, review, and marketing.

2. Force concrete procedures.
   - Every `SKILL.md` must include numbered, executable steps.
   - Name exact artifacts, commands, and verification checks where applicable.

3. Force safety defaults.
   - Prefer dry-run / preview behavior when relevant.
   - Require confirmation before destructive or irreversible actions.
   - Document failure modes and recovery steps.

4. Force realistic examples.
   - Include examples that reflect real repo constraints, not toy placeholders only.
   - Provide at least one smaller-scope example and one larger-scope example.

5. Force meaningful `_ALT` divergence.
   - `_ALT` skills must be materially different in strategy, risk posture, or optimization goal.
   - Do not create cosmetic rewrites.
   - Use these divergence directions (or compatible equivalents):
     - `{{alt_strategy_a}}`
     - `{{alt_strategy_b}}`

6. Force pack-level coherence.
   - Explain how the skills fit together and where they belong in categories.
   - Update templates/rubric only if needed, and keep changes minimal and intent-preserving.
   - If templates/rubric are updated, state exactly why each change is required by this pack.

7. Force validation/lint iteration.
   - Run `skills-validate` and `skills-lint` after generating the pack.
   - Fix BLOCKER and HIGH issues before proceeding.
   - Iterate until scores are high and the pack is reviewable.

## Deliverables

- New skills under `{{category_root}}...`
- `_ALT` variants for each new skill
- Any minimal template/rubric updates required by the pack
- A short category fit plan (where these skills belong and how they compose)
- Validation/lint results summary (including what was fixed during iteration)

## Anti-Goals

- Do not create a new numbered `.prompts/PROMPT_XX.txt` file from this template.
- Do not expand project scope beyond `{{project_pattern}}`.
- Do not introduce new subsystems unless they are directly required by the pack.
