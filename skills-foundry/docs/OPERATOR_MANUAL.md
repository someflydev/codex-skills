# Operator Manual

## Purpose

Run the skills-foundry workflow end-to-end on repositories that use ordered `.prompts/` files.

## Planned Workflow

1. Author/update skills and templates.
2. Validate and lint skills.
3. Sync skills into `~/.codex/skills`.
4. Use installed skills on a target repo.

## Status

This is an initial scaffold created by `PROMPT_01`. Command behavior is stubbed and expanded in
later prompts.
