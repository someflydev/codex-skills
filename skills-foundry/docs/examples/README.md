# Curated Example Outputs

Tracked snapshots for front-facing docs and packaging.

These are intentionally curated excerpts/samples (not live runtime `reports/` output), so the repo can show proof artifacts without requiring a local rerun first.

Current samples:

- `skills-sync-dry-run.txt` - example sync plan output
- `skills-lint-summary.md` - sample lint summary excerpt
- `skills-catalog-snippet.md` - sample rendered catalog excerpt
