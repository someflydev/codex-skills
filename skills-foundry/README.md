# skills-foundry

Repo-local toolkit for authoring, validating, linting, and syncing Codex skills.

This scaffold is created by `PROMPT_01` and intentionally starts with runnable CLI stubs,
foundational docs, and test scaffolding. Later prompts implement the real behavior.

## Current Status

- Project structure exists
- `bin/` CLIs are runnable and support `--help`
- Docs placeholders are present
- Pytest scaffolding is present

## Next Steps

Implement templates and validation/lint logic in `PROMPT_02`, then sync/install logic in
`PROMPT_03`.
