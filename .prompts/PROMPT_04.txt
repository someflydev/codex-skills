Generate the “Prompt-First Repo Workflow” core skill pack (the real meat).

Create these skills (each with a corresponding _ALT variant):
Category: workflow/

1) prompt-preflight-inspector
   - reads .prompts directory
   - checks ordering, missing dependencies, unclear instructions, overengineering risks
   - produces:
       .prompts/improvements-before-initial-run.txt
       skills-foundry/reports/preflight.md (when run from foundry tooling)
   - suggests fixes in severity tiers:
       BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / NIT
   - includes optional “apply fixes” mode:
       --apply
       --max-fix-severity MEDIUM (default; one of BLOCKER,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW,NIT)
       --write-patches (creates .patch files)
   - if apply is used:
       - generates a commit plan, grouped by theme
       - recommends `git add -p` patch groupings
       - commits with:
           [PRE-FLIGHT] <message>

2) prompt-stage1-runner
   - verifies tool availability (git, language runtimes, docker if needed, etc.)
   - refuses to run if prerequisites missing
   - provides install guidance (macOS Homebrew + common Linux package managers)
   - runs PROMPT_00_s then PROMPT_01..N (or selected range)
   - after each prompt completes:
       - summarizes changes
       - proposes commit groups + messages:
           [PROMPT_XX] <imperative summary>
       - recommends `git add -p`
       - optionally commits automatically if user confirms

3) prompt-postflight-analyzer
   - loads repo filesystem + .prompts
   - produces STAGE-1-POST-FLIGHT.md
   - includes:
       - completeness score /100 (rubric)
       - excellence score /10
       - top missing artifacts
       - risk register (overengineering, unclear docs, fragile setup)
       - recommended stage-2 investments

4) stage2-plan-generator
   - reads STAGE-1-POST-FLIGHT.md + repo + .prompts
   - proposes 3–6 new PROMPT_XX.txt files
   - each new prompt:
       - has explicit deliverables and acceptance criteria
       - avoids duplicate work
       - “max out” completeness/excellence scoring

5) stage2-preflight-inspector
   - same behavior as stage-1 preflight, but focused only on new stage-2 prompts
   - applies fixes + commits with [PRE-FLIGHT]

6) stage2-runner
   - runs new prompts in order
   - commits after each prompt with [PROMPT_XX]
   - includes rollback guidance

7) stage2-postflight-analyzer
   - produces STAGE-2-POST-FLIGHT.md
   - highlights delta from stage-1 scores
   - identifies remaining gaps and “not worth it” items

For each skill:
- write SKILL.md with full metadata and all required sections
- ensure procedures are executable and tool-aware
- include examples for:
  - a small repo (10 prompts)
  - a larger repo (25 prompts)
- ensure _ALT differs meaningfully:
  - e.g. different scoring rubric emphasis, different fix strategy, different commit grouping philosophy

Verification gate before proceeding to the next prompt:
- Run `skills-validate` and `skills-lint` after generating this pack.
- Fix BLOCKER and HIGH issues found in the generated workflow skills before continuing.
