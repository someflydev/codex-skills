Generate the “Storage Zoo + Synthetic Data Lab” skill pack.

Create these skills (with _ALT variants):
Category: storage-labs/

1) storage-zoo-planner
   - goal: propose a menu of storage paradigms to experiment with for realistic synthetic data:
       - relational (Postgres, SQLite)
       - document (MongoDB)
       - key-value (Redis/KeyDB)
       - columnar analytics (DuckDB)
       - graph (Neo4j)
       - search (Elasticsearch or Meilisearch)
       - streaming/log (Kafka or Redpanda)
   - backend-language-agnostic:
       - interface contracts (HTTP/JSON, CLI, import/export formats)
       - dataset shapes/sizes across industries
       - realistic workflows (ingest, query, report, archive, replay)
   - outputs:
       docs/STORAGE_ZOO_PLAN.md
       docs/DATASETS_CATALOG.md
       data/ (seed generators spec files, not necessarily full generators yet)
   - includes Docker Compose recommendations and “small machine” profiles

2) synthetic-data-spec-author
   - given an industry + workflow, outputs:
       data/specs/<industry>/<dataset>.yaml
   - spec format:
       entities, relationships, cardinalities
       fields with distributions
       time-series behavior
       referential integrity rules
       PII-safe rules + redaction policy
   - includes examples:
       ecommerce, healthcare scheduling, fintech ledger, SaaS billing, logistics, education

_ALT differences:
- one emphasizes “few datasets, very deep realism”
- one emphasizes “many datasets, broad coverage, lighter realism”
