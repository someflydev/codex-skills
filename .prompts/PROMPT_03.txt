Implement skill installation / sync to ~/.codex/skills with safety, backup, and diffing.

Deliverables:
1) bin/skills-sync:
   - supports:
       --from skills/ (default)
       --to ~/.codex/skills (default)
       --dry-run
       --backup-dir ~/.codex/skills-backups/<timestamp> (default)
       --strategy {copy,symlink}
       --only <skill-id> (repeatable)
       --prune (remove skills in target not present in source; requires confirmation)
   - behavior:
       - runs skills-validate and skills-lint first; refuses sync if validate fails
       - prints a concise plan:
           create / update / unchanged / would-prune
       - dry-run prints plan only
       - real run:
           - creates backup of any overwritten SKILL.md
           - copies or symlinks skill folder into ~/.codex/skills/<skill-id>/
           - writes ~/.codex/skills/INDEX.md with a categorized list + short descriptions
2) skills-render (optional but recommended):
   - renders a “skills catalog” markdown page:
       skills-foundry/reports/SKILLS_CATALOG.md
   - includes tags, inputs, expected_tools
3) docs updates:
   - explain copy vs symlink tradeoffs
   - explain how to version skills
4) tests:
   - use tmp dirs to validate sync creates expected structure
   - test dry-run does not write

Now that sync exists, create a small “starter pack” of 3 trivial skills to prove the pipeline works:
- hello-skill
- repo-tree-summarizer
- changelog-drafter
Include _ALT variants for at least one of them.
