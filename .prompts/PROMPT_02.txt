Build the “skill file” template system and validators/linters.

Deliverables:
1) templates/skill/SKILL.md.tmpl
2) templates/skill/EXAMPLES.md.tmpl
3) templates/skill/CHECKLIST.md.tmpl
4) bin/skills-new:
   - creates a new skill folder at skills/<category>/<skill-id>/
   - fills in templates with provided metadata flags
   - creates SKILL.md, EXAMPLES.md, CHECKLIST.md
   - enforces stable kebab-case skill-id
5) bin/skills-validate:
   - finds all skills under skills/**/SKILL.md
   - validates YAML front matter schema
   - validates required sections exist
   - validates links/paths referenced in outputs (best effort)
   - returns non-zero if failures
6) bin/skills-lint:
   - scores each skill against docs/SKILL_RUBRIC.md
   - emits:
       skills-foundry/reports/skills-lint.json
       skills-foundry/reports/skills-lint.md
   - includes per-skill:
       completeness_score_100
       excellence_score_10
       top_issues (ordered)
       suggested_fixes (concrete edits)
7) tests:
   - test that validate fails for missing YAML fields
   - test that lint scoring works on a sample skill

Rubric requirements (must be encoded and enforced):
- has all required sections
- procedure steps are numbered and explicit
- inputs are typed + examples
- mentions expected_tools and safety confirmations
- has realistic examples
- has failure modes and recovery
- avoids being too broad (flag “scope too wide”)
- avoids being too vague (flag “steps not executable”)

Do not sync to ~/.codex/skills yet (that’s PROMPT_03).
