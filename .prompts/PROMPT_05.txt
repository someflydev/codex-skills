Generate the “Polyglot Backend Options Advisor” skill pack.

Create these skills (with _ALT variants):
Category: polyglot/

1) backend-language-shortlister
   - given a problem domain description + constraints (perf, hiring, portability, simplicity)
   - proposes 15 languages
   - for each language:
       - 2–3 web server frameworks (or stdlib option)
       - core strengths (constructs/paradigms)
       - risks/costs
       - fit for HTMX + Tailwind + Plotly-style rendering
       - dev workflow notes (testing, packaging, env mgmt)
   - outputs:
       docs/BACKEND_OPTIONS.md (or skills-foundry/reports/BACKEND_OPTIONS.md)
   - ends with a clear “choose one” interaction:
       - present a selection menu and what the user needs to answer

2) backend-choice-to-prompts
   - takes the chosen language/framework combo
   - generates additional super-excellent ordered PROMPT_XX.txt files (written into .prompts/)
     that implement the backend with the chosen stack and project constraints.
   - emphasizes:
       - minimal frontend JS
       - HTMX-first
       - sensible templates
       - clear data layer boundaries

Make the _ALT versions meaningfully different:
- one favors “boring + stable + easy hiring”
- one favors “learning value + unique paradigms”
