Write/update `skills-foundry/templates/packs/pack.md.tmpl` as a reusable prompt template file that,
when given:
- a new project pattern you repeat (e.g. “API client scaffolding”, “release checklist”, “Docker hardening”)
will generate:
- 5–12 new skills
- each with SKILL.md and _ALT
- plus any needed updates to templates/rubric
- plus a plan for where they fit in categories

Constraints for this prompt-template artifact:
- Treat the path above as the canonical output for this step (do not create a new numbered
  `.prompts/PROMPT_XX.txt` file here).
- Keep it compatible with the path convention in PROMPT_00_s.txt (repo-root-relative paths by default).

This generator prompt should:
- force narrow scope
- force concrete procedures
- force safety defaults
- force realistic examples
- force meaningful _ALT divergence
- run validate/lint and iterate until scores are high
