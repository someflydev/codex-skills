Implement the repo-local “skills-foundry/” project scaffold.

Requirements:
- Create the directory structure described in PROMPT_00_s.txt.
- Write docs:
  - docs/SKILLS_OVERVIEW.md: what this is, how skills are organized, how sync works
  - docs/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md: how to write great skills, common patterns, anti-patterns
  - docs/SKILL_RUBRIC.md: a checklist/scoring rubric used by the linter (0-100 + 0-10 excellence)
  - docs/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md: end-to-end usage for real repos with .prompts
- Create bin scripts (stubs first, but runnable with --help):
  - bin/skills-new
  - bin/skills-validate
  - bin/skills-lint
  - bin/skills-sync
  - bin/skills-render
  - bin/repo-preflight
  - bin/repo-stage1-run
  - bin/repo-postflight
  - bin/repo-stage2-plan
  - bin/repo-stage2-run
- Each bin script:
  - is a small CLI with argparse
  - supports --help and exits 0
  - prints clear next steps if called without required args

Implementation notes:
- Prefer a single Python entrypoint module (e.g. skills_foundry/cli.py) with console scripts,
  OR keep it ultra-simple with python scripts in bin/.
- If you choose the console-scripts approach, create the `skills_foundry/` package directory in the
  scaffold now so later prompts have a concrete entrypoint location.
- Include at least minimal tests scaffolding in tests/ with pytest.

Do not generate the actual skill library yet (that’s PROMPT_02+).
