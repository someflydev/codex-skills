Summary:
- Performed a post-flight audit of the prompt plan (`.prompts/PROMPT_00_s.txt` .. `PROMPT_08.txt`) against the as-built repository filesystem.
- Verified inventory, core CLI behavior, tests, docs, generated skill packs, smoke-run evidence, and prompt-to-artifact traceability.
- Wrote `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md` and `FRONT_FACING_IDEAS.md` with scoring, issue prioritization, and frontend/packaging recommendations.
Top 10 issues found:
- P0: `repo-*` operator CLIs remain PROMPT_01 scaffold stubs, leaving the top-level prompt-first workflow promise only partially implemented.
- P1: `skills-foundry/README.md` is stale and still describes pre-PROMPT_02/PROMPT_03 status.
- P1: `skills-validate` emits false-positive `missing_output_path` warnings for `Confirm` strings due loose front-matter list scanning.
- P1: `OPERATOR_MANUAL.md` documents unsupported `skills-sync --only skill-a,skill-b` syntax; parser expects repeated `--only` flags.
- P1: `skills-lint` scores placeholder scaffold content (`smoke-check`) as 100/10, undermining excellence scoring credibility.
- P2: No CI workflow exists to run tests/smoke checks automatically.
- P2: Test coverage is narrow (6 tests) and misses `skills-new`, `skills-render`, sync prune/symlink paths, and `repo-*` CLIs.
- P2: `SKILL_RUBRIC.md` is descriptive only; lint scoring logic is hardcoded and can drift from docs.
- P2: Runtime proof artifacts in `skills-foundry/reports/` are git-ignored, reducing durable front-facing evidence.
- P2: Repo root lacks a README, so the nested `skills-foundry/` deliverable is not discoverable from first landing.
Fixes applied during this run:
- None (audit/docs/log only; no code or behavior changes applied).

Summary:
- Applied previously identified P0/P1 fixes across repo workflow CLIs, validator/linter heuristics, sync CLI/docs semantics, and the nested `skills-foundry` README.
- Re-ran local verification (`.venv/bin/pytest -q`, `bin/skills-validate`, `bin/skills-lint`) and refreshed `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md` + `FRONT_FACING_IDEAS.md` to reflect the new post-fix state.
- Confirmed no remaining P0/P1 issues in the updated audit; remaining items are P2/P3 packaging, CI, and scope/automation clarity improvements.
Top 10 issues found:
- P2: `repo-*` workflow CLIs are MVP planning/snapshot helpers, not full prompt execution automation.
- P2: No CI workflow exists for pytest + CLI smoke checks.
- P2: Test coverage remains narrow for `skills-new`, `skills-render`, repo helper CLIs, and sync prune/symlink paths.
- P2: Repo root still lacks a `README.md`, so first-time users may miss the nested `skills-foundry/` deliverable.
- P2: Runtime proof artifacts are generated but not curated as tracked examples for front-facing packaging.
- P2: `skills-validate` warnings remain noisy for intentionally future output paths (best-effort `missing_output_path`).
- P2: `SKILL_RUBRIC.md` can drift from scoring logic in `_skills_common.py` because rubric rules are code-defined.
- P3: Smoke proof is documented in prose but not packaged as a reproducible script target.
- P3: Lint reports emit absolute filesystem paths, which hurts portability of shared snippets/screenshots.
- P3: Empty `skills/docs-tools/` category is present but unexplained in front-facing docs.
Fixes applied during this run:
- `skills-foundry/bin/_repo_workflow.py` :: + added shared MVP repo workflow helper implementation (preflight inventory, stage run plans, postflight snapshot, stage-2 plan) :: replaces stub-only behavior with useful helper functionality

- `skills-foundry/bin/_skills_common.py` :: + placeholder/template wording penalties in `lint_skill()` :: lowers false-perfect scores for scaffold content (e.g., `smoke-check`)
- `skills-foundry/bin/skills-sync` :: + normalize comma-separated `--only` values while retaining repeated-flag support :: aligns CLI behavior with docs examples
- `skills-foundry/tests/test_skills_sync.py` :: + regression test for comma-separated `--only` syntax :: verifies sync selection parsing
- `skills-foundry/docs/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md` :: ~ updated `--only` syntax guidance and smoke evidence notes :: matches current CLI semantics and linter behavior

- `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md` :: ~ refreshed audit/scoring/priority issues after P0/P1 fixes :: updated completeness/excellence and traceability statuses
- `FRONT_FACING_IDEAS.md` :: ~ replaced stale “stubbed”/placeholder caveats with current helper-only and heuristic wording :: packaging guidance now matches repo state

Summary:
- Applied the next high-leverage P2 batch: added `skills-sync` prune/symlink test coverage, categorized validator output-path warnings for better triage, and added curated tracked proof snippets under `skills-foundry/docs/examples/`.
- Re-ran local verification (`.venv/bin/pytest -q`) and checked validator warning output to confirm new warning codes are emitted.
- Refreshed READMEs, `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md`, and `FRONT_FACING_IDEAS.md` to reflect the reduced remaining P2 scope and improved packaging evidence.
Top 10 issues found:
- P2: `repo-*` workflow CLIs are still helper-only and may be interpreted as stronger automation than implemented.
- P2: `skills-validate` warnings are categorized now but still high-volume for content-heavy packs.
- P2: `SKILL_RUBRIC.md` remains descriptive while scoring logic is code-defined (`_skills_common.py`), so drift risk remains.
- P3: Smoke proof is documented but not packaged as a repeatable script target.
- P3: Runtime lint reports still emit absolute paths (curated examples mitigate this for front-facing docs only).
- P3: `docs-tools/` empty category remains unexplained in front-facing docs.
- P3: Nested-project layout is improved by root README, but a visual repo map would help onboarding.
- P3: Validator/linter parser edge cases need broader tests as heuristics evolve.
- P3: Curated examples now exist but should be refreshed when report formats change.
- P3: Release packaging still lacks license + release checklist/changelog guidance.
Fixes applied during this run:

Summary:
- Applied the next high-leverage P2 batch: added `skills-validate` warning suppression/grouping UX and documented rubric authority in `SKILL_RUBRIC.md`.
- Added validation regression coverage for warning suppression/summary behavior and re-ran the full test suite.
- Refreshed `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md` and `OPERATOR_MANUAL.md` to reflect the reduced remaining P2 list and new validation triage ergonomics.
Top 10 issues found:

Summary:
- Applied a higher-leverage P3 batch: added a repeatable smoke script target, made lint reports repo-relative by default (with absolute-path opt-in), and documented the previously empty `docs-tools` placeholder category.
- Added lint path-format regression coverage and re-ran the full test suite; verified the smoke script and lint path output behavior manually.
- Refreshed `POST_FLIGHT_REPORT.md`, `FRONT_FACING_IDEAS.md`, and operator docs to reflect the reduced remaining issue set.

- P3: Packaging/release signals remain thin (no license or lightweight release checklist/changelog guidance).
- P3: Nested-project orientation still benefits from a visual repo map / first-5-minutes flow.
- P3: Validator/linter parser edge cases need broader tests as heuristics evolve.
- P3: Curated examples should be refreshed when report/output formats change.
- P3: Smoke script and smoke docs could drift unless one is treated as the source of truth.
- P3: A compact validation output preset/alias would further reduce operator friction.
- P3: Front-facing proof can still be strengthened with one full lint JSON sample and one prune example.
