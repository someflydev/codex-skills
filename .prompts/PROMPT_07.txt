Wire everything together into a cohesive end-to-end operator experience, and prove it works.

Deliverables:
1) Update docs/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md to include:
   - “install skills-foundry”
   - “author or update skills”
   - “validate + lint”
   - “sync to ~/.codex/skills”
   - “use skills on a new repo”
   - “prompt-first repo lifecycle” walkthrough:
       stage-1 preflight -> stage-1 run -> stage-1 postflight
       stage-2 plan -> stage-2 preflight -> stage-2 run -> stage-2 postflight
2) Ensure all bin scripts are runnable and have sane defaults.
3) Add a sample “demo repo” folder under skills-foundry/demo-repo/ with:
   - a tiny .prompts set (5–7 prompts, simple)
   - instructions to run the workflow on it
4) Run (or at least make it easy to run) the full pipeline:
   - skills-new (for one skill)
   - skills-validate
   - skills-lint
   - skills-sync --dry-run
5) Ensure the skills catalog and index are generated.

Finally, add a short “Design Notes” section explaining:
- how to keep skills narrowly scoped but composable
- how to avoid overengineering in skills themselves
- how to evolve skill packs over time without breaking IDs
