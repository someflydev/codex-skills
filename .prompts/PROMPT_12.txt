Stage-2 Prompt 4/5
Title: Packaging + Release Hygiene Baseline (License Decision + Deprecation Policy)

Objective
Close the remaining packaging/release gap by adding a real license (with explicit human choice), documenting alias deprecation timing, and tightening release-readiness docs so the repo is clearer to reuse externally. This prompt is intentionally packaging-focused and must not expand into deployment/distribution automation.

Dependencies / Sequencing
- Designed order: after `PROMPT_10.txt` and `PROMPT_11.txt`
- Runnable independently: partially (requires a human license choice)
- If no explicit license choice is provided at run time, STOP and report the blocker before making legal-text changes

Human Decision Required (must ask before applying legal text)
- Choose one license for this repo (examples: `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `BSD-3-Clause`, or another explicitly requested by the user)
- Do not invent/customize legal license text without explicit instruction

Artifacts To Create / Modify (exact paths)
- `LICENSE` (repo root) — conditional on explicit license choice
- `README.md`
- `skills-foundry/README.md`
- `skills-foundry/docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- `skills-foundry/CHANGELOG.md`
- `skills-foundry/docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` (new; document `repo-*` alias deprecation window and removal target)

Required Scope
1) Add a standard license file at repo root after explicit user choice.
2) Document deprecation policy/timeline for deprecated `repo-*` aliases:
   - what is deprecated
   - canonical replacement (`repo-helper-*`)
   - target removal milestone/date/version placeholder
3) Tighten release docs:
   - `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` references `LICENSE` and `DEPRECATIONS.md`
   - `CHANGELOG.md` includes a note for the deprecation policy entry
4) Update READMEs to reference:
   - chosen license
   - deprecation policy doc
   - current helper-only execution scope (if wording drifts)

Acceptance Criteria (commands + expected checks)
Two-path acceptance:

A) If license choice is provided (success path)
```bash
test -f LICENSE
rg -n "repo-helper-\\*|DEPRECATIONS\\.md|License" README.md skills-foundry/README.md skills-foundry/docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
test -f skills-foundry/docs/DEPRECATIONS.md
```
Expected:
- all commands succeed
- deprecation policy file exists and mentions deprecated `repo-*` aliases + canonical replacements

B) If license choice is NOT provided (blocked path)
- Prompt must stop and report: "License choice required"
- Must not add a fabricated/custom license text

Anti-Scope (do NOT do)
- Do NOT publish to PyPI / package indexes
- Do NOT add release automation pipelines, signing, SBOM, or provenance tooling
- Do NOT add legal review commentary beyond standard template insertion + docs references
- Do NOT create a custom license

Overengineering Guardrails
- One license file, one deprecations doc, and small README/checklist updates
- Keep deprecation policy simple and human-readable (no policy engine, no config registry)
- No release tooling automation in this prompt

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: wrong license text or wrong scope
  - Mitigation: require explicit user license choice before writing `LICENSE`
- Risk: deprecation timing promises too much
  - Mitigation: document a realistic placeholder milestone and "subject to change" language if no versioning cadence exists yet
- Risk: docs drift across root and nested README
  - Mitigation: update both in the same prompt and verify with `rg`

Evidence To Include In Diff
- `LICENSE` header and identifier (if chosen)
- `skills-foundry/docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` deprecation table/timeline snippet
- README/release-checklist references to license + deprecations policy
